# DSPM: Defining Custom Classifiers

*Scenario A:* You work for an organization that tags it's intellectual property with "Company Confidential â€“ Internal Only".

*Scenario B:* You work for a military contractor that is required to tag all content with a "Secret", "Classified", or "Unclassified" sensitivity label. 


## Exercise:

1. *Scenario A:*  Create one ore more custom classifiers to generate a data finding when protected data is detected.
2. *Scenario B:* Generate one or more custom classifiers that generates a data finding when a file does not contain a required sensitivity level.
3. *Scenario B:* Your managers asks you to ensure all files that stored with a sensitivity label. Generate a control that alerts when a bucket contains a file that does not contain one of the required sensitivity levels.
